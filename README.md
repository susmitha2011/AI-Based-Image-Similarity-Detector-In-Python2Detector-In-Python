AI BASED IMAGE SIMILARITY DETECTOR IN PYTHON
Task Description: Create a Python-based tool that takes two images as input and determines whether they are the same or similar using basic AI techniques. The tool should output whether the images are identical, visually similar, or completely different based on pixel comparison or feature extraction.
1. Basic Python Programming
Understand data types, functions, and control structures (if, for, etc.). Learn how to read and write
files.
2. Install and Use Python Libraries
Install and import libraries like opencv-python, numpy, Pillow, and optionally scikit-image or
imagehash.
3. Read and Display Images
Use OpenCV (cv2.imread) or Pillow (Image.open) to load images. Optionally display images using
cv2.imshow or matplotlib.
4. Convert and Resize Images
Convert both images to the same size and grayscale for comparison. Use OpenCV: cv2.resize,
cv2.cvtColor.
5. Compare Images: Pixel-Level
Use techniques like Mean Squared Error (MSE), Structural Similarity Index (SSIM), or hashing
(dHash, imagehash).
6. Decide Threshold and Print Result
Based on the similarity score, define a threshold to label images as: Identical, Similar, or Different.
7. (Optional) Add GUI or CLI Input
Use tkinter for GUI file upload or argparse to pass images via command line
